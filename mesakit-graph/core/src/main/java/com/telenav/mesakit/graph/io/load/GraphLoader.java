 * {@link GraphStore} manage the loaded details are private to those objects.
 * <p>
 * Graph loaders are implementation details for loading {@link Graph} objects from various data sources. If you need to
 * load a {@link GraphArchive}, use {@link GraphArchive#load(Listener)}. If  you need to load some other kind of graph
 * resource, use the {@link SmartGraphLoader}, which will load graphs from any supported format:
 * <pre>

 *       [...]
 *     var resource = new File(...);
 *     var graph = new SmartGraphLoader(resource).load(LOGGER);
